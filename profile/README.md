# StreamElements Unveils State of the Stream Report for January 2025

StreamElements unveiled its *State of the Stream* report for January 2025, revealing familiar patterns in Twitch viewership. As is often the case, numbers declined in December but saw a resurgence at the start of the new year.

## Key Insights:
- **New Leader Among Streamers**: This month's rankings bring a fresh leader among streamers.
- **Marvel Rivals Disrupts the Most-Watched Games List**: NetEase’s *Marvel Rivals* has disrupted the list of the most-watched games.

## Marvel Rivals' Impact
StreamElements, in collaboration with Rainmaker.gg, reports that *Marvel Rivals* ranked as the fourth most-watched category on Twitch in January, based on total hours viewed.

*Marvel Rivals* has made a significant impact, joining the ranks of established favorites like *League of Legends* and *Grand Theft Auto V*, and even outperforming games like *Fortnite* and *Dota 2*.

- Twitch’s daily hours watched grew from 54 million to 57 million in January, contributing to a total of 1.77 billion hours watched for the month.

## Twitch Streamers:
Along with the change in the games lineup, Twitch witnessed **Caedrel**’s return to the top streamer spot, partly due to his participation in the *Games Done Quick* event.

**JonVlogs** also made it onto the list after hosting a subathon that featured a star-studded lineup of Brazilian celebrities, as reported by StreamElements.

## NetEase's Decisions:
Even with *Marvel Rivals* performing well, NetEase has reportedly laid off its North American development team. The Chinese team, however, remains unaffected and is still focused on adding new content to the game.
